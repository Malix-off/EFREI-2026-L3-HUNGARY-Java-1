# Java Homework

## Guidelines

- ### Exercice 1

  - [x] Create a zoo (of some sorts)
  - [x] Have a common ancestor class: animal
  - [x] Each animal should have a name
  - [x] Have a three other classes that extend that class (zebra, elephant, python)
  - [x] Implement the makesound feature that we have seen on the slide.
  - [x] The animals should have their own methods and variables (use your imagination)
  - [x] Create an interface called hasLegs with a letsRun method and a getNumberOfLegs method and then implement that interface for the animals that have legs.
  - [ ] Create a common array for the animals _(did not understood the assignement)_

- ### Exercice 2

  - [ ] Write a program that takes a number from standard input and displays it. For this, we will use an object (an instance) of the Scanner class and particularly its nextInt() method.

- ### Exercice 3

  - [ ] Modify the previous program so that it reads from the keyboard a series of positive or zero real numbers (corresponding to notes), ending in the value -1, and calculates the Olympic average of these values, i.e. the average of the scores regardless of the highest or lowest score.
